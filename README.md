# JB Modelarija System ‚Äì Information System Development Project

This repository contains the full development of an information system designed for the needs of the company **JB Modelarija Bla≈æeka d.o.o.** as part of the university course *Information System Development* (PIS) at the Faculty of Organization and Informatics, University of Zagreb.

The system models real business processes related to **procurement**, **finance**, and **production**, and demonstrates the application of system analysis and design techniques including process modeling, data modeling, and implementation via Oracle APEX.

## üß≠ Project Purpose and Scope

The project was conducted in a team of three students with the objective of analyzing, modeling, and implementing an information system that reflects the operational workflows of a real-world manufacturing company. The system focuses on:

- **Procurement process:** Managing suppliers and incoming orders
- **Production monitoring:** Employees, production tracking, material usage
- **Finance overview:** Cost allocation and tracking (model-level)
